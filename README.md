## SMS Spam Prediction

Welcome to the SMS Spam Prediction project repository! This project focuses on utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). Through the application of machine learning algorithms, including Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), this project aims to accurately identify and filter out spam messages.

### Overview

The proliferation of unsolicited SMS spam poses a significant challenge in communication channels. This project addresses this issue by developing a robust model capable of automatically detecting spam messages. By leveraging NLP techniques and advanced machine learning algorithms, we aim to create a reliable solution for filtering out unwanted spam content.

### Techniques Used

**1. Data Preprocessing:**
   - Tokenization: Splitting messages into individual words or tokens.
   - Text Cleaning: Removing special characters, stopwords, and performing stemming or lemmatization.
   - Feature Engineering: Extracting relevant features from text data, such as word frequencies or TF-IDF scores.
   
**2. NLP Techniques:**
   - Bag-of-Words (BoW): Representing text data as a vector of word frequencies.
   - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF): Weighting words based on their importance in a document corpus.
   - Word Embeddings: Mapping words to dense vector representations using techniques like Word2Vec or GloVe.
   
**3. Machine Learning Models:**
   - Multilayer Perceptron (MLP): A type of neural network suitable for classification tasks.
   - Other classifiers like Random Forest, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines for comparison.
   
**4. Advanced Techniques:**
   - Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance by tuning hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search.
   - Ensembling: Combining predictions from multiple models to improve overall accuracy.
   - Model Evaluation: Utilizing metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
